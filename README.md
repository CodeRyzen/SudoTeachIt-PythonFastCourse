# SudoTeachIt-PythonFastCourse

This repository contains source code that I manually rewrote while following the Python crash course by **SudoTeachIt** on YouTube.

It serves as a personal learning archive and a way to better understand Python by copying, adapting, and commenting on every example from the course.
